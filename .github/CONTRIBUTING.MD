# Contributing guidelines

1. Create a fork of the repository
1. Create a feature branch for your issue or new feature. Ideally you will have raised an issue first and the commit will be referencing the issue or feature request.
1. Push into a feature branch
1. Create a pull request into DEVELOPMENT branch
1. I will then merge it into master providing the review and all tests are passed.
